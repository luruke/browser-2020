It's 2020, and browsers can do amazing stuff.  

This repo contains a non-exhaustive list of less-known features implemented in browsers **today**.

This list isn't intended for a technical audience; instead it wants to be a "I didn't know we could do that in a browser!" list.

In many cases, listed features aren't yet part of the standard, and may only be available on certain browsers or configurations.

## [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme)
Many OSes provide light or dark color theme (notably dark mode on macOS). Websites can detect the preferred color scheme.

---

## [prefers-reduced-motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion)
Similarly to dark mode, users in their OS can remove/reduce animations, we can also detect that.


For Firefox, the `reduce` request is honoured if:

- In GTK/GNOME: GNOME Tweaks > General tab (or Appearance, depending on version) > Animations is turned off.

  - Alternatively, add `gtk-enable-animations = false` to the `[Settings]` block of [the GTK 3 configuration file](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GTK#Configuration).

- In Plasma/KDE: System Settings > Workspace Behavior -> General Behavior > “Animation speed” is set all the way to right to “Instant”.
- In Windows 10: Settings > Ease of Access > Display > Show animations in Windows.
- In Windows 7: Control Panel > Ease of Access > Make the computer easier to see > Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible).
- In macOS: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion.
- In iOS: Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.
- In Android 9+: Settings > Accessibility > Remove animations.
- In Firefox `about:config`: Add a number preference called `ui.prefersReducedMotion` and set its value to either `0` for full animation or to `1` to indicate a preference for reduced motion. Changes to this preference take effect immediately.
